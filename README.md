# Logistic Regression for SMS spam detection



**Date:** April 20, 2025

Learned how to **clean a text dataset** and why it's important:

- **Removed punctuation** from messages to reduce noise.
- Used **`stemmer.stem()`** to get the base/root form of words. Example: "running", "runs", "ran" â†’ "run".
- Removed **stopwords** (like "the", "is", "and") that don't add much meaning.
- Learned what **text vectorization** is and how it helps convert raw text into numerical format using `CountVectorizer`, so that machine learning models can understand it.

I'll explore more about **vectorization methods** (like TF-IDF, embeddings, etc.) next time.
